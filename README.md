## Features ‚ú®

Mix Elements: Combine up to 3 different elements with adjustable quantities to create various compounds.

Dynamic Visuals & Enhanced Animations: Experience stunning visuals as elements are poured into the central flask, complete with swirling, fizzing, and glowing effects during reactions.

Rich Sound Design: Enjoy realistic sound effects for pouring, reactions, successes, and errors, all with a toggleable sound control for your convenience.

Safety First: The simulator detects and prevents dangerous combinations, providing users with a warning message to ensure a safe learning environment.

Real-time Feedback: Receive instant status messages about the reaction process and a performance overview of the application.

Comprehensive Information: Access educational chemical equations and detailed product information, including pH levels, safety ratings, and brief descriptions of each compound.

Lab Analytics: Track your personal lab usage with features like a simulated visitor counter and a count of your total reactions.

Intuitive Interface: Navigate through a clean, responsive design with keyboard shortcuts for easy interaction.
